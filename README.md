# snake_game
This is my version of the classic Snake game, built using Java to highlight my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills. I designed the game with clear, reusable classes for components like the snake, food, and game logic, making the code easy to understand and extend. The game features a start and game-over menu with functional buttons and keyboard shortcuts (Alt+S to start, Alt+E to exit, Alt+R for rainbow mode, and Alt+T for static colors). Event handling is a big part of the projectâ€”I used the Action interface and KeyEvent to enable smooth snake control with either arrow keys or WASD. To keep the gameplay responsive, I implemented multithreading, allowing the game loop and other mechanics to run independently without lag. The visuals are rendered using Graphics2D for a clean, polished look.
